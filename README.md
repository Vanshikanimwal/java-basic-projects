Number Guessing Game 🎯

Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.

How It Works

The game selects a random number between 1 and 100.

The player has 5 attempts to guess the correct number.

After each guess, the game provides feedback:

"🔼 Too low! Try again." if the guess is smaller than the number.

"🔽 Too high! Try again." if the guess is greater than the number.

"🎉 Congratulations!" if the player guesses correctly.

If the player cannot guess within the given attempts, the game reveals the correct number.
